/*
 *
 * Suppose that we have three processes related as grandparent, parent, and child, and 
 * that the grandparent doesnâ€™t immediately perform a wait() after the parent exits, so that the parent becomes a zombie. 
 * When do you expect the grandchild to be adopted by init (so that getppid() in the grandchild returns 1): 
 * after the parent terminates or after the grandparent does a wait()? Write a program to verify your answer.
